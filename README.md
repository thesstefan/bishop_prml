# PRML Solution Manual

My own comprehensive solution manual for Chris Bishop's [Pattern Matching and Machine Learning](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/uploads/prod/2006/01/Bishop-Pattern-Recognition-and-Machine-Learning-2006.pdf)
exercises. The document is written using LaTeX and the PDF file can be accessed [here](https://github.com/thesstefan/bishop_prml/blob/build/prml_solution_manual.pdf).
